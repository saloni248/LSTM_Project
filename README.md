## Author
**Saloni Gupta**

## Overview
This project applies a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict stock prices for **JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)** based on historical market data. The LSTM model is well-suited for time-series forecasting and can capture long-term dependencies in stock price trends.

## Features
- **LSTM Model** for stock price prediction.
- **Evaluation** using Mean Squared Error (MSE), RMSE, and R² score.
- **Comparison** of JPM stock performance with the S&P 500 Index.
- **Technical Analysis** using indicators like Moving Averages, RSI, and Bollinger Bands.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Pandas, NumPy
- Yahoo Finance API (`yfinance`)

## Results
- **R² Score:** 0.91
- **MAE:** 4.69
- **RMSE:** 16.11
